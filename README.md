## Usage
Save the `sample-streambest-config.json` as `streambest-config.json` and modify it so it fits your needs, then run streambest like this

```
$ streambest --source {media}
```

You can use any source ffmpeg can normally use.  
You might need to change the ffmpeg command in the config a bit for your usecase (for example to downmix 5.1 audio to stereo).
